OnvifLogInfoTester

This small program checks if camera does support the ONVIF-functions:
GetSystemLog, GetSystemSupportInformation, GetSystemBackup and GetSystemUris

It was developed for onvif-spotlight.bemyapp.com

The program will connect to the camera-address put into the corresponding field.
Port can be used by printing "ip-address:port".

If you leave "Enter IP" empty, the program will connect to all six onvif-spotlight.bemyapp.com cameras after each other.
